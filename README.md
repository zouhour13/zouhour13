## 🌟 Projects
Here are a few of the projects I've worked on:  

**💻 Final Year Project (PFE) – Automatic Defect Detection for Automotive Components**  
This project focused on developing an **automatic defect detection system** for automotive components using **Computer Vision and AI**. Conducted in an industrial environment at **Valeo Enfidha**, the project followed the **CRISP-DM methodology** and applied advanced deep learning techniques using **YOLOv8-seg**.  
- Two models were trained on annotated datasets via **Roboflow**: one for buttons, one for pictograms.  
- An intuitive interface developed with **Flask** allows real-time visualization of predictions.  
- This solution demonstrates the effectiveness of AI technologies for improving **quality control in industry** and opens the door for future system evolution. 

**🎵 Emotion Classification System**  
A deep learning model for classifying emotions from audio files using CNN and LSTM.  

**🎬 Video Colorization Project**  
A project that automatically colorizes grayscale videos using AI techniques.  

**📊 Olive Oil Demand Prediction**  
A machine learning project predicting olive oil demand using Gradient Boosting and Extra Trees regressors.
